First app from "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" by Mashrur Hossain.
Alpha Blog is a simple app for creating articles. Users can sign up and post an article with title, body and categories.

The main focus of this app is:
- Build a custom authentication system from scratch;
- Add styling using Bootstrap classes;
- Build one-to-many and many-to-many associations;
- Add profile images using gravatars;
- Use pagination for listing views.
